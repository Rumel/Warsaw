This is a script I wrote to do batch conversion of video files through handbrake.

You need to go into the script and change the top variables and you also need to have
HandBrakeCLI in your PATH variable. If you don't want to do that you can change it in
the conversion string.

The script works by reading files from an input directory.
It then checks if it's a video file.
After that it checks to see if it already exists in the output directory.
If it doesn't it converts it and then writes to a logfile.
If it already exists it just skips it and moves on to the next file.
