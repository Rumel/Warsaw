This is a script I wrote to do batch conversion of video files through handbrake.

To have this script run properly you need to go into the script and change the top variables.

The script reads in a directory of files, and then converts it based on the extensions
you have supplied to it. It iterates through the files and then will do another check
to see if any new files have been added to the directory. If there has been it continues
running otherwise the program terminates. The program also writes to a logfile.
